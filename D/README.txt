To Calculate the D metric we will need two inputs:

1. Log transformed Stdev (same as in R) (instructions on how to perform this are found in the code).

2. Spike position pairs and the reciprocal of the distance that separates them on the strucure of spike. This is obtained after running the code found in the trimer_distance folder.

The outcome of D calculations is given for each cluster of sequences. The average among all clusters is the D value of each position.
