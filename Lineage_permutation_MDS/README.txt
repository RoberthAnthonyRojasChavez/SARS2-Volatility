The code compares n-feature vectors from different groups (e.g., lineages) and determines the specificity of the vecotrs for group based on Euclidean distances between vectors from the same versus different groups.

The code permutes group (lineage) identifiers, and outputs P-values that describe the relationship between the intra-lineage Euclidean distance and the inter-lineage distance.
