The scripts were validated on Pycharm and IntelliJ IDEA in a macOS environment (Monterrey V 12.4). Running the code in a Windows environment (Tested on Windows 10 Enterprise 20H2) may result in formatting issues.
Instructions to run the code are found within each folder and within the code as comments.

Installation time: No installation of our code is required.

Expected run time: Unless otherwise stated, code ran in a Windows 10 machine, i7-10700 @2.90gHZ, 60Gb RAM DDR4 3000 Mhz. Storage device: PCIe NVMe Gen3 3D NAND. Code runs in macOS ran in a MacbookAir M1 with 8Gb of RAM.

To obtain V, D and R metrics, run code in the following order (expected overall run time in parentheses):

	1. Tree (2 min)
	2. AA_seqs (2 min)
	3. V (2 min)
	4. D (5 min - in macOS)
	5. R (3 min)

Other Code:
	6. Lineage_permutation_MDS (20 min)
	7. V_permutation (5 min)
